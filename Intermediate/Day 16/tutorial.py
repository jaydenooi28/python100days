# This Python code snippet is using the Turtle graphics library to create a simple drawing. Here's a
# breakdown of what each part of the code does:
# from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# timmy = Turtle()
# print(timmy)

# my_screen = Screen()
# print(my_screen.canvheight)

# timmy.shape("turtle")
# timmy.color("coral")
# timmy.forward(100)

# my_screen.exitonclick()

# This Python code snippet is using the `prettytable` library to create a formatted table. Here's a
# breakdown of what each part of the code does:


# import prettytable as pt
# table = pt.PrettyTable()
# table.field_names = ["Pokemon Name", "Type"]
# table.add_rows(
#     [
#         ["Pikachu", "Electric"],
#         ["Squirtle", "Water"],
#         ["Charmander", "Fire"],
#     ]
# )

# table.align = "c"
# print(table)
